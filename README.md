                                                            Lazy Minting Detailings

1. Lazy Minting NFTs are the new type of NFTs that allows creators to mint NFTs on demand without paying the upfront costs.

2. It means the creators will not pay any upfront cost until the buyers buy the nfts with the desired price set by the creators of the nfts off-chain.

3. Creators will just create a signature off-chain which includes nft metadata such as tokenId, tokenURI, price, etc.

4. Buyers will have to pay the upfront cost of minting as well as the price which is set by the creators off-chain.

5. By using hash and signatures buyers will buy the nft from the creators on the chain.

6. After buying the nfts on-chain, The nfts will mint and will get transferred to the buyer.

The difference between normal minting and lazy minting are as follows:- 

Normal Minting NFT’s:-

    1. It uses ERC721 or ERC1155 standards.

    2. Creators must first mint the nfts on-chain.

    3. Buyers will just pay the price which is set by the seller.

    4. Nfts will get mint only by the seller.

    5. The use case of normal minting nfts is in the nft-marketplace which is opensea, rarrible, etc

Lazy Minting NFT’s:- 

    1. It also uses the same standards as normal minting uses.

    2. Creators will not mint nfts on-chain instead creators will just create signature off-chain.

    3. Buyers must have to pay the minting upfront cost as well as price which is set by the seller.

    4. Nfts will get mint when buyers buy the nft by paying the desired price.

    5. The use case of lazy minting nfts is in the nft-marketplace which is opensea, rarrible, etc. As they are offering free minting as an option.

The advantages of lazy minting are as follows:- 

    1. Cost-effective:- Unlike opensea or Rarrible or any other nft-marketplace creators have to pay some upfront cost as a minting cost which could depend on the current network congestion to list the nft on all these platforms. But if the nfts don’t get sold to the buyer then the creator's efforts could go into vain and creators will face heavy losses. Therefore, Lazy minting is very cost-effective in terms of creators.

    2. Flexible:- In lazy minting, Nfts can get sold on a global space instead of one platform.

The disadvantages of lazy minting are as follows:-

    1. Unaccountability:- It means that the genuine creator's talent will not get recognized because of lazy minting nfts because anyone can copy nft from Google or from somewhere else and will create a signature out of it by giving a token URI off the chain. Due to this lazy minting hasn’t come upstream.
